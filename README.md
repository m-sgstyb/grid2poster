# Grid2Poster

Generate print-ready posters of electrical grid infrastructure from OpenStreetMap data.

The script downloads country-level power infrastructure, including transmission lines, substations, and power plants, then renders a static poster using GeoPandas, OSMnx, and Matplotlib.

## Data

GridToPoster uses OpenStreetMap features tagged as:

- `power=line`
- `power=minor_line` when enabled
- `power=cable` when enabled
- `power=substation`
- `power=plant`

Feature completeness depends on OpenStreetMap coverage in the selected country or region.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install osmnx geopandas matplotlib numpy pandas shapely tqdm
```

## Usage

```bash
python create_grid_poster.py --country Germany
```

For large countries, reduce the Overpass query tile size:

```bash
python create_grid_poster.py --country France --tile-size-km 150
```

Export as SVG or PDF for vector workflows:

```bash
python create_grid_poster.py --country Spain --format svg
python create_grid_poster.py --country Poland --format pdf
```

Include additional infrastructure layers:

```bash
python create_grid_poster.py --country Germany --include-minor-lines --include-cables
```

List available themes:

```bash
python create_grid_poster.py --list-themes
```

## Output

Generated posters are written to the `posters/` directory by default. Intermediate OSM responses and processed geometries are cached in `cache/` to avoid repeated downloads.

## Notes

The script uses the public Overpass API through OSMnx. Large requests may fail or be rate-limited. Use smaller `--tile-size-km` values for large countries or when the Overpass server is busy.

The map is intended for visualisation and print design. It should not be used as an authoritative grid model.
